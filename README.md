# Data Science Final Project 2021

###  **Group members:** Emma Crenshaw, Carmen Rodriguez, Aiza Malik, Ligia Flores


## Github Files Description:

(1) Project Webscraping
  
   - The file contains the R code used to scrape the data from https://www.recipetineats.com/ 
    
   - Output dataset: recipes_final.csv
         
     
(2) Quality Checks 
  
  - Quality checks of webscraped data, addressed and so no HTML file is shown.
  
(3) Project Data
  
  - Data set created by the webscraping
  - The variables available are described below:
    - _recipe_: Name of the recipe
    - *cook_time*: Amount of time the recipe takes to actively cook (minutes)
    - *prep_time*: Amount of preparationt time the recipe takes (minutes)
    - *course*: Course of the recipe (ex: main)
    - *cuisine*: Type of cuisine. This could be a single string or a list
    - *rating*: The average rating of the recipe form 1-5
    - *n_ratings*: The number of ratings the recipe has
    - *servings*: Number of servings the recipe yields
    - *ingredients*: List of ingredients used in the recipe, separated by a semicolon
    - *n_ingredients*: Number of ingredients
    - *n_steps*: Number of steps in the recipe
    - *calories*: Number of calories per serving in the recipe
    - *carbs*: Number of grams of carbohydrates per serving 
    - *protein*: Grams of protein per serving
    - *fat*: Grams of total fat per serving
    - *sat_fat*: Grams of saturated fat per serving
    - *poly_fat*: Grams of polyunsaturated fat per serving
    - *mono_fat*: Grams of monounsaturated fat per serving
    - *sodium*: mg of sodium per serving
    - *potassium*: mg of potassium per serving
    - *fiber*: Grams of fiber per serving
    - *sugar*: Grams of sugar per serving
    - *vitamin_c*: mg of vitamin A per serving
    - *vitamin_a*: international units (IU) of vitamin A per serving
    - *calcium*: mg of calcium per serving
    - *iron*: mg of iron per serving
