# Data Science Final Project 2021

## Project Overview
It can be hard to judge the quality of online recipes without trying them as a home chef, and it can be hard as a content creator to determine how to best market your recipes. We want to determine if we can predict the popularity of online recipes with just the easily quantifiable information provided with most recipes, such as number of ingredients, cook time, and number of recipe steps. This could allow users to better identify aspects of a recipe that may make it a better choice and could help content-creators finetune their recipe creation.

_Objective_

Determine how well we can predict the popularity of a recipe (i.e., number of reviews) based on the easily ‘seen’ aspects of a recipe (i.e., number of ingredients, time it takes to make, etc) and create an algorithm to help recipe creators predict whether a recipe will be popular.

_Data_

Recipes from **Recipetin Eats**: https://www.recipetineats.com/


## Github Files:

  (1) Project Webscraping
  
      - The file contains the R code used to scrape the data from https://www.recipetineats.com/ 
      
      - Output dataset: recipes_final.csv
     
     
  (2) Quality Checks 
      - Quality checks of webscraped data, addressed and so no HTML file is shown.
  
  (3) Project Data
      - Data set created by the webscraping
  
  (4) Machine Learning - Random Forest
      - Prediction of recipe popularity using a random forest algorithm
  
  (5) Machine Learning - 
  
  (6) Map of world cuisine popularity
